This web application helps users find clinical trials based on their medical criteria. Users can create a secure profile to store their medical information, which is then used to match them with relevant clinical trials. The application allows users to log in and out, save favorite trials, and automatically moves inactive or expired trials to a separate list. Additionally, users can continuously update their medical profile to receive the most accurate trial recommendations.

This application is built using the following technologies:
React for building the user interface and handling user interactions.
JavaScript for the core logic and functionality of the application.
APIs to fetch relevant clinical trials based on user medical criteria, and to manage user favorites and trial statuses.
